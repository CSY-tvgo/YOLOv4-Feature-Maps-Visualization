# YOLOv4-Feature-Maps-Visualization  

![](./examples/example.gif)  

## Introduction  
Based on [rrddcc/YOLOv4_tensorflow](https://github.com/rrddcc/YOLOv4_tensorflow), we implement a jupyter notebook to observe feature maps of YOLOv4.  
Click this [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h1n5n87wvczlw6v/yolov4_coco.pb?dl=0) to download model weight, then run the `.ipynb` file.  

## Acknowledgement  
Thanks to [rrddcc](https://github.com/rrddcc) for his implementation of YOLOv4 on TensorFlow.  
I also appreciate support from VeriMake, issues are welcome on [VeriMake BBS](https://verimake.com/) *(in Chinese)*.
